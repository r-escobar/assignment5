Description: Our ray tracer.  Includes all required features.  KD tree used to
			 accelerate ray-object intersection (always on).

Disclaimers: Anti-aliasing is turned off by default (to match the solution), but
			 is implemented and ready for use (just lower supersample threshold). 

Extra Credit: Includes a creative scene for extra credit section 6.2.  Named
			  smileyface.ray, this scene displays a smiley face built using
			  geometric primitives.
